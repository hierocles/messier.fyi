Before you begin the installation process, ensure your system meets the following requirements.

## System Requirements

- **Wabbajack**: Automated modlist installer. 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://wabbajack.org/">Download here <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="2" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" className="lucide lucide-move-up-right w-4 h-4 font-extrabold" style={{ display: 'inline' }}><path d="M13 5H19V11"></path><path d="M19 5L5 19"></path></svg></a>
  - To avoid false positive issues with antivirus software, add your Wabbajack folder to the exclusion list. It's also a good idea to add an exclusion for the modlist install directory.
- **Premium subscription** to [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/) is highly recommended to speed up downloads, but is not required.
- **Clean** installation of Starfield `v1.14.74.0` + Shattered Space DLC in a folder that is **not** in Program Files or Program Files (x86).
  - If you only have one drive, use LostDragonist's [Steam Library Setup Tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) to create a new library in the root of your drive, e.g. `C:\SteamLibrary`.
  - This is the latest version as of November 19, 2024.
  - You should turn off Steam automatic updates.
- **Storage**: 340GB available space (downloads + installed mods), **SSD Required**.
    - Total storage space can be reduced by deleting downloads after installation. Downloads can be stored on a separate drive, if needed.

If enabling HD textures, you will need a decent amount of VRAM. Some areas of Starfield, like New Atlantis, will stutter even with a 4090.

<Note type="warning" title="Important">
  Cannot stress enough that you **must** have an SSD to run this modlist.

## Note on NVIDIA Drivers

If you plan on using Luma HDR, you will need to downgrade your NVIDIA driver to 566.36. The latest driver is not compatible with Luma HDR and will result in a black screen.
